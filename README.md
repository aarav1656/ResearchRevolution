# ResearchRevolution

A DeSci Project built on FVM Blockchain

Focussed on =>

Landing Page:

Provide an overview of the platform's vision, emphasizing open access, reproducibility, and incentives for scientists.
Highlight the benefits of decentralized science, such as removing barriers, fostering collaboration, and enabling unique research funding sources.
Include a clear call-to-action to encourage researchers to join and contribute.
User Registration and Authentication:

Implement a user registration process where researchers can create accounts and authenticate their identities.
Integrate blockchain-based authentication mechanisms for enhanced security and trust.
DataDAO Creation:

Allow registered users to create their own DataDAOs, which will serve as repositories for their papers, experimental results, and other research artifacts.
Implement smart contracts to handle the creation and management of DataDAOs, including ownership, access control, and tokenization.
Paper and Experiment Upload:

Provide an interface for researchers to upload their papers, ensuring open access and the inclusion of comprehensive metadata (e.g., authors, publication date, keywords).
Enable the upload of experiment results as proofs, including relevant data, methodologies, and code.
Implement version control systems to track changes and updates to papers and experiments.
Incentive Mechanism:

Develop a token economy that incentivizes researchers to upload new papers and contribute to the platform over time.
Define a reward system where researchers earn tokens based on the quality, impact, and usage of their uploaded papers.
Integrate the token system with smart contracts to automate token distribution and ensure transparency.
Fair Peer Review Process:

Integrate quadratic voting as a mechanism to enhance the fairness of the peer review process.
Allow registered users to allocate their tokens to vote on papers, with the voting power increasing quadratically with the number of tokens allocated.
Implement a transparent and auditable system that records and displays the voting results.
Reproducible Scientific Code:

## Future Works

Promote the use of standardized coding practices among researchers.
Encourage researchers to provide well-documented and modular code that accompanies their papers and experiments.
Implement tools and features that allow code sharing, version control, and the recreation of scientific code.
Data Science and Metadata Analysis:

Enable data science on the collected papers and associated metadata.
Develop analysis tools that allow researchers to perform metadata analysis, derive insights, and facilitate collaboration.
Provide a user-friendly interface to explore and search the available papers and associated data.
Community Interaction:

Implement features for researchers to engage in discussions, provide feedback, and collaborate within the platform.
Enable researchers to establish connections, form research groups, and initiate collaborative projects.
